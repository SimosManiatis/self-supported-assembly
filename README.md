# Self-Assembling Truss Structures with Robots

This Python project simulates the design, control, and assembly of truss structures using a team of autonomous robots. The robots collaborate to construct trusses by attaching struts at predefined points based on a structural blueprint. The project combines computational geometry, robotics control, and structural engineering principles to demonstrate how autonomous agents can build scalable, robust truss systems.

## Project Overview

Truss structures are used in bridges, roofs, and space stations due to their lightweight and high strength-to-weight ratio. This project aims to automate the assembly of these structures using a team of robots. The robots operate autonomously, with minimal human
